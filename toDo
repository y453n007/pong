[done!!] ~ Game Setup and Initialization:

    - Set up the game canvas to render the game elements. [√]
    - Initialize game variables:
        * ball position. [√]
        * paddle positions. [√]
        * scores. [√]

[done!!] ~ Rendering:
    - Draw the game elements on the canvas:
        * ball. [√]
        * paddles. [√]
        * scoreboard. [√]

[inProgress!!] ~ User Input Handling:
    - Handle keyboard events to allow players to control their paddles. [...]
    - Update paddle positions based on user input. [...]
    ******* double check the velocity calculation *****

[waiting!!] ~ Game Logic:
    - Implement the game rules and mechanics:
        * ball movement. [X]
        * collision detection. [X]
    - Update the ball's position and direction based on its velocity. [X]
    - Check for collisions with the walls and paddles and adjust the ball's direction accordingly. [X]
    - Update player scores when the ball goes off-screen (missed by a player). [X]

[waiting!!] ~ Real-time Communication (Client-side):
    - Set up the socket connection to the server using socket. [X]io-client. [X]
    - Emit events to the server when a player moves their paddle. [X]

[waiting!!] ~ Real-time Communication (Server-side):
    - Set up the Nest. [X]js server to handle WebSocket connections. [X]
    - Implement event listeners on the server to receive client events. [X]
    - Broadcast game state updates to all connected clients to keep them in sync. [X]

[waiting!!] ~ Multiplayer Functionality:
    - Allow players to join specific rooms or instances of the game. [X]
    - Implement logic to handle player:
        * joining. [X]
        * leaving. [X]
        * syncing game state between clients in the same room. [X]

[waiting!!] ~ Game Over and Restart:
    - Determine when the game is over (reaching a certain score or time limit). [X]
    - Display the winner. [X]
    - Provide an option to restart the game. [X]

[waiting!!] ~ Optimization and Latency Reduction:
    - Consider implementing server-side prediction and client-side interpolation to reduce latency. [X]
    - Optimize the rendering of game elements for better performance. [X]

[waiting!!] ~ Testing and Bug Fixes:
    - Test the game thoroughly for bugs and edge cases, both in single-player and multiplayer modes. [X]
    - Address and fix any issues found during testing. [X]
